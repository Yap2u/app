            const transcript = `On September 7, 1876, the most notorious outlaw gang in American history rode into the quiet town of Northfield, Minnesota. The Jesse James Gang, led by the infamous Jesse James and his brother Frank, had come to rob the First National Bank in what would become one of the most dramatic and disastrous bank robberies of the Wild West era.

The James-Younger Gang, as they were also known, had been terrorizing banks and trains across Missouri, Kansas, and neighboring states for over a decade. This robbery was different - it was their first major heist outside their familiar territory, and the citizens of Northfield were ready to fight back.

The gang consisted of eight members: Jesse James, Frank James, Cole Younger, Jim Younger, Bob Younger, Charlie Pitts, Clell Miller, and Bill Chadwell. They had spent days in Northfield, posing as cattle buyers and horse traders, carefully studying the bank and the town's routines.

On that fateful Thursday afternoon, the plan was simple: three men would enter the bank while the others created a diversion outside. Jesse James, Bob Younger, and Charlie Pitts entered the First National Bank while Frank James and the rest of the gang waited outside on horseback, ready for a quick escape.

Inside the bank, the outlaws encountered unexpected resistance. Joseph Lee Heywood, the acting cashier, refused to open the vault despite threats and violence. When the robbers demanded access to the safe, Heywood bravely declared he could not open it, even though it was actually unlocked. His heroic refusal would cost him his life.

Outside, the situation was deteriorating rapidly. Bill Chadwell, who was supposed to be the gang's local guide, had underestimated the resolve of Northfield's citizens. As soon as townspeople realized what was happening, they began firing from windows and doorways with rifles and shotguns.

The robbery quickly turned into a fierce gun battle in the streets. Clell Miller was shot and killed almost immediately, and Bill Chadwell soon followed. The gang's horses were being shot from under them, and the carefully planned escape was turning into a desperate flight for survival.

After shooting Heywood and another bank employee, the surviving gang members rushed out of the bank empty-handed. The vault had remained closed, and they had stolen less than $30 from the cash drawer - a pittance compared to their usual hauls of thousands of dollars.

The chase that followed became legendary. For two weeks, one of the largest manhunts in Minnesota history pursued the surviving gang members through swamps, forests, and farmland. Cole, Jim, and Bob Younger were eventually captured, wounded and exhausted, while Jesse and Frank James managed to escape back to Missouri.

The Northfield raid marked the beginning of the end for the James Gang. The botched robbery had cost them half their members and showed that their reign of terror was not unstoppable. The citizens of Northfield had proven that ordinary people could stand up to the most feared outlaws of their time.

Joseph Lee Heywood became a national hero, honored for his courage in refusing to open the vault despite facing death. His sacrifice saved the bank's money and helped bring down the most notorious criminal gang of the era. Today, Northfield celebrates "Defeat of Jesse James Days" every September, commemorating the day their town fought back against the Wild West's most wanted men.

The failed Northfield robbery demonstrated that the age of the Wild West outlaw was coming to an end. Better communication, improved law enforcement, and citizens willing to defend their communities meant that even the most feared criminals could no longer operate with impunity.`;
