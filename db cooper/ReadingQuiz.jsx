The first models of the universe were developed by Greek and Indian philosophers, which put Earth at the center. Later, when data was more accurate, Nicolaus Copernicus created a model with the Sun at the center of the Solar System.

Eventually, after more improvements, scientists were able to say that our Solar System is in the Milky Way galaxy, which is one of many galaxies in the universe.

The Big Bang theory explains how many people believe the universe began. In the beginning, the universe was tiny and then expanded over billions of years to the size it is today. Giant clouds came together during this process to form galaxies, stars and other physical things in the universe.

It is not known exactly how big the universe is. Information that is sent from Earth may never reach some parts of space, because it expands faster than light can travel across it.

However, astronomers have calculated that the universe is 13.8 billion years old.`
